🚀 Understanding Import/Export in JavaScript

When we declare values or functions in one file and want to use them in another, we need to grasp the import/export concept. Here's a guide to help you get started! 📚

🔄 Exporting:

The export keyword allows you to share code across files. There are two types of exports:

1️⃣ Named Exports:

With named exports, you need to import values individually by their name. Here's how you can do it:

a.) Export Individually

b.) Export All at Once
You can export everything at the bottom, but remember, you cannot export them before defining:

2️⃣ Default Exports
In default exports, you don't have to import them by name, which makes them simpler to use in some cases.

📥 Importing
The import keyword is used to bring in code from other files. You can even use the as keyword to give an imported value a new name! There are several ways to import code:

a.) Importing Named Exports
